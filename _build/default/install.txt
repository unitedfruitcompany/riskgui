Steps:

Go to "https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ak829/CS-3110-Final-Project-Risk"
and click on the green "code" button. You should see an option to
"Download ZIP". Click on that button and the zip for the project should be
downloaded onto your computer. Now we will do the following:

1) Go into your Linux terminal and run the following:

mkdir riskGame

2) Move that ZIP file into your work directory. Zip directions to the credit
of Cornell, found at (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2022sp/a1/).

Linux and Mac: You have it easy. Just move the ZIP file into the a1 directory 
you created earlier through whatever means you normally would use.

Windows: You need to get that ZIP file into your WSL filesystem. 
Here are a few options, listed (I hope) from least to most annoying:

Option 1. Open the Windows File Explorer and navigate to \\wsl$. 
There you will see your installed Ubuntu distributions. 
(If not, open an Ubuntu terminal, leave it running, 
and try again with File Explorer.) You can navigate to your WSL 
home directory at /home/<your_wsl_username>, open the riskGame directory 
you created earlier, then drag-and-drop the ZIP file into it.

Option 2. Let’s assume you saved the ZIP file in your Downloads folder 
on your C drive under the name CS-3110-Final-Project-Risk-main.zip. 
In Ubuntu, cd into the riskGame directory you created earlier, 
then run this command:

$ cp /mnt/c/Users/<your Windows user name>/Downloads/CS-3110-Final-Project-Risk-main.zip
 
That will copy the ZIP file from Windows into WSL.

Option 3. Open VS Code from WSL, making sure that the bottom left of the 
VS Code window has a green area that says “WSL: Ubuntu-20.04”. Use VS Code 
to open the a1 directory you created earlier inside your WSL home directory.
Drag the ZIP file from wherever you saved it into the VS Code explorer pane, 
inside the a1 folder. That will copy the ZIP file into your WSL filesystem.

3) Extract the ZIP file. Do this from the terminal, not from a graphical 
interface. First, run cd riskGame to enter the directory you created earlier. 
Then run 

unzip CS-3110-Final-Project-Risk-main.zip. 

You should now see all of the Risk game code extracted into your riskGame 
directory. For example, if you run ls, you will see a src directory, a Makefile, 
a dune file, etc. 

4) Once you're in the project, type "make build".

5) Once the build is finished, type "make run" to run the project and the game
should run!

Side note: to run the tests, type "make tester" in the terminal
