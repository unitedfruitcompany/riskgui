   we're looking at. The implementation should provide an easy and fast way to
   access the element before and the element after. The whole chain (that is,
   the connected component of any of its elements) is called a stack. There is
   no particular type for a stack. *)

(* The only non trivial (fun) part of the implementation is to decide what
   "depth" should be attributed to an element when adding or inserting a new
   element in a chain.  In our implementation, the two directions "prev" and
   "next" are not symmetric. In a symmetric implementation, each insertion would
   cut the depth interval in two equal parts, hence, since max_int = 2^62, in
   the (very) worst case, we can roughly only insert 62 elements to a chain
   before we need to reattribute depths. Here we decide that "insert_after" is
   more common than "insert_before" -- we will use the Chains for graphic
   layers, and it's more usual to add a layer on top of the previous one rather
   than inserting a layer "below" an existing one.

   So, when appending a new element, we simply add a constant value to the
   depth: sqrt(max_int). Therefore we may append sqrt(max_int) elements in a
   row.  *)
