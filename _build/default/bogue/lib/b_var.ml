(** variables with mutex, to perform atomic operations *)

(* WARNING contrary to what the OCaml Mutex doc seems to say: (fixed in ocaml
   4.12)

   https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Mutex.html

   calling Mutex.lock on a mutex locked by the SAME thread will ALSO block.

TODO starting from ocaml 4.12 one could use the Atomic module in order to avoid
   locking. Anyways, for single reading/assignement, it seems that we can get
   rid of locks. See
   https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/threads-and-atomicity-of-reading-and-assignement/8923/3

Remark: if optimization is needed, one could check whether
   [Utils.threads_created <> 0] before playing with mutexes.  *)
