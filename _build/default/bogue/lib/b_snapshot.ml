(* We create a Box widget whose image will be a snapshot of a given room. *)
(* The texture is initialized at the startup event, or upon user call. *)

(* In order to achieve this, we hijack the Layout.display function, which uses
   blits in layers, and render the layers to a target texture. Hence the
   assumption is that the layers blits are empty. This means that creating
   snapshots should NOT be done in a separate thread: the risk is to corrupt
   layers in case it is called at the same time as the Bogue.render function. *)

(* Just in case, we have added a mutex to the current_layer. but still... *)

(* When we create the widget, the size of the box may not be the same as the
   size of the widget at the time it receives the startup event... *)

(* TODO: we have trouble rendering correctly when the room background has alpha
   channel... ? use the new https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode??
   *)

(* Warning: a new texture is created at every update, because size might
   change. TODO add an option in case we want to be fast and reuse the same
   texture? *)
