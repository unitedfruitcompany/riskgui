# Bogue ![bogue-icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanette/bogue/master/bogue-icon.png)

_Bogue_ is an all-purpose GUI (Graphical user interface) library for
[ocaml](https://ocaml.org/), with animations, written from scratch in
`ocaml`, based on [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/).

* Can be used to add interactivity to any program.
* Can work within an already existing event loop, for instance to add
  GUI elements to a game.
* Uses the __SDL2 renderer__ library, which makes it quite fast.
* Can deal with several windows.
* _Bogue_ is __themable__, and does not try to look like your
  desktop. Instead, it will look the same on every platform.
* Graphics output is scalable (without need to recompile), and hence
  easily adapts to __Hi-DPI displays__.
* Predefined animations (slide-in, fade-in, fade-out, rotate).
* Built-in audio mixer.

Programming with _bogue_ is easy if you're used to GUIs with widgets,
layouts, callbacks, and of course it has a functional flavor.  â€‹It uses
__[Threads](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Thread.html)__
when non-blocking reactions are needed.

# Features

## Widgets

Widgets are the building bricks, responsible for graphic elements that
respond to events (mouse, touchscreen, keyboard, etc.).

For a more "functional" use, they can be "connected" instead of
reacting with callbacks (see examples).

* boxes with decorations (round corner, border, shadow, gradient
  background, image pattern)
* check box
* push button (with labels or images)
* rich text display (bold, italics, underline), any TTF font can be used.
* image (all usual formats, including SVG)
* slider (horizontal, vertical, or circular)
* text input with select and copy-paste
* SDL area for free drawing with the whole SDL Renderer API

## Layouts

widgets can be combined in various ways into layouts. For instance, a
check box followed by a text label is a common layout.

Several predefined layouts are available:

* sliders (horizontal, vertical, circular). Can be used as progress bars
* scrollable lists (that can easily handle a large number of elements,
  like one million)
* multi-column tables with sortable columns
* multiple tabs with slide-in animation
* modal popups
* various menus (menu bar, drop down menus with submenus)
* drop-down select lists
* radio lists
* automatic tooltips can be attached to any element

Layouts can be __animated__ (slide-in, transparency, rotation).  All
layouts can be automatically __resized__ when the user resizes the
window. __Timeouts__ are available to execute arbitrary actions after
a delay.

# Installation

## Using the opam package
This is the easiest way unless you want to try out the development version.

```
opam install bogue
```

That's it.

## Building from sources

### Prerequisites

You need a working `ocaml` installation with `opam`, see the [ocaml doc](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html). Then, make sure
you have `dune`, `tsdl`, `tsdl-image` and `tsdl-ttf`:
```
opam install dune tsdl tsdl-image tsdl-ttf
```

### Get the latest source

Download the
[git archive](https://github.com/sanette/bogue/archive/master.zip),
unzip it, cd into the `bogue-master` dir, and then:

```
dune build
opam install .
```

# Documentation

It's good to first have a look at Bogue's
[general principles](http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Principles.html).

The public API can be found
[here](http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Bogue.html).

# Examples

You should first try a
[minimal example](http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Bogue.html#example).

The `examples` directory contains more sophisticated examples. If you
installed the `bogue` package with `opam` (as described above), these
examples are available via the `boguex` program. For instance, run
examples 34 and 41 by:

```
boguex 34 41
```

Type `boguex -h` to have the list of all examples.
