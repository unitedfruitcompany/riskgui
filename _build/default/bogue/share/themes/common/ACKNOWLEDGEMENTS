This directory contains material that I have downloaded from the
internet and it is my understanding that I may pack them in the bogue
distribution. However, if it happens that a legal reason should
prevent me from doing so, please inform me and I will withdraw them.

Currently contains a couple of the nicely legible Ubuntu fonts.  This
